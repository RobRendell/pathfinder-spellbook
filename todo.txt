    regex: (uses|takes) (up )?a (spell )?slot
    Some descriptions use words (one, two), some a digits (2)

Current algorithm to get domains/bloodlines/patrons from sources is wrong, misses many.
domains: actual 152 vs correct core/apg 124
bloodlines: actual 42 vs correct core/apg 27
patrons: actual 37 vs correct core/apg 24

Arcanist has prepared spontaneous slots (i.e. like Sorcerer who can change their spells known each day).

"back" navigation for hyperlinks between spell descriptions.

Corrections to spell data?  Beast Form II doesn't <i> the ref to Beast Form I, Malfunction has school of "transformation" rather than "transmutation"

In Known Spells panel, show a running # of spells known at each level (for spontaneous casters and spell book pages)

Opposing Schools that take up two spell slots

Metamagic feats (or at least, the ability to memorize lower-level spells into a higher-level slot and note the level difference).

For "not spell slots" options, nominate which other list of slots it is added to (e.g. bloodline added to sorcerer list, patron added to witch list etc)

"Remove all" control in prepared spell panel, akin to "clear all" control in known spells panel.

Scroll to top on setCurrentView... $('.panel').scrollTop() didn't work

Remove reliance on id in createCheckboxControl etc. - should have direct access to the div

Fix checkbox list (spontaneous casters) outside of level's div, using next() instead of parent() in checkboxInteraction();
