Also download feats from pathfindercommunity.net too, to get Metamagic feats?

    regex: (uses|takes) (up )?a (spell )?slot
    Some descriptions use words (one, two), some a digits (2)

How will the final version work?
* Choose sources/class(es)/bloodlines/domains/patrons/school
* Configure spells per day
    * For each class/bloodline/domain/patron/spell school, choose prepared (all spells), prepared (selection) or
        spontaneous, nominate # of spells per day of each level
* Pick spells known/spells in spellbook
    * Option to add bloodline spells, patron spells
* Track spells today:
    * spontaneous classes just list spells known and show a slot counter per-level which can be incremented/decremented
    * cross spells (or slots) off. Also can un-cross (Pearl of Power etc).
    * rest to restore everything
        * prepared lists can be changed at this time:
            * add/remove spells manually (including duplicates, metamagic feats)
    * prepared lists: save/load current selection as named list ("wilderness", "town", "infiltration" etc)

Gaps:
    * Doesn't know which classes are prepared and which are spontaneous.

Current algorithm to get domains/bloodlines/patrons from sources is wrong, misses many.
domains: actual 152 vs correct core/apg 124
bloodlines: actual 42 vs correct core/apg 27
patrons: actual 37 vs correct core/apg 24
