Bonus slots (school/domain), slots used by opposed schools etc. aren't reported in adventuring tab when you haven't memorized as much as you can.

Style favoured school/opposing school/domain spell (border)

Bloodlines and Patron spells.

Think about ways to improve the preparation interface... perhaps have the known spells on the LHS in an accordion, and the prepared slots on the RHS scrolling independently?

Only show patrons if APG?  Patrons and bloodlines in Spells Known (listed by caster level rather than spell level)

Close dialog button (when clicking on view icon for a spell and seeing full description) not working on Android (and PC?)

Don't show spells in preparation tab when daily slots == 0, even if some are marked as known.

"Remove all" control in prepared spell panel, akin to "clear all" control in known spells panel.  Set all/clear all in details panel too?

Change spellData.spellByName to spellById, use name.toId() instead of toLowerCase()?

Embrace hash navigation fully, use it to select current book, instead of manual back() method to go back, rebuild in full on load.

"back" navigation for hyperlinks between spell descriptions.

In Known Spells panel, show a running # of spells known at each level (for spontaneous casters and spell book pages)

Corrections to spell data?  Beast Form II doesn't <i> the ref to Beast Form I, Malfunction has school of "transformation" rather than "transmutation"

Ultimate Magic alternate specialty schools? http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateMagic/spellcastingClassOptions/wizard.html

Spell details dialog doesn't always appear in visible screen area (if scrolled down).

maxLevel for classes etc. derived from data rather than hard-coded

Also download feats from pathfindercommunity.net too, to get Metamagic feats?

    regex: (uses|takes) (up )?a (spell )?slot
    Some descriptions use words (one, two), some a digits (2)

Current algorithm to get domains/bloodlines/patrons from sources is wrong, misses many.
domains: actual 152 vs correct core/apg 124
bloodlines: actual 42 vs correct core/apg 27
patrons: actual 37 vs correct core/apg 24

Fix checkbox list (spontaneous casters) outside of level's div, using next() instead of parent() in checkboxInteraction();

Arcanist has prepared spontaneous slots (i.e. like Sorcerer who can change their spells known each day).
